@App:description("Check if a number is greater than or less than a particular constant")

/*

Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to check if an input number is greater than or less than a constant(35) and display the result to the output console.
        ex: If the user inputs 55, the application outputs 'Number is greater than 35" because 55 is greater than 35

Prerequisites:
    1) Save this sample

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'.
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console.
        * IfElseApp - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
    You may send events via event simulator
        a) Open the event simulator by clicking on the second icon on the left or pressing Ctrl+Shift+I.
        b) In the Single Simulation tab of the panel, specify the values as follows:
            * Siddhi App Name  : IfElseApp
            * Stream Name      : CheckNumberStream
        c) In the num(INT) field, enter an integer value(ex: 55) and then click Send to send the event.
        d) Send some more events.

Viewing the Results:
    INFO {org.wso2.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.LogSink} - LOGGER : Event{timestamp=1568282141766, data=[Number is greater than 35], isExpired=false}

*/

define stream CheckNumberStream (num int);

@sink(type='log')
define stream OutputStream(result string);

@info(name='IfElseQuery')
from CheckNumberStream
select ifThenElse(num > 35,'Number is greater than 35','Number is less than 35') as result
insert into OutputStream;
