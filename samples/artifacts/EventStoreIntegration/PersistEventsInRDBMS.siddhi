@App:description('Receive events via simulator and persist the received data in the rdbms store.')

/*

Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to perform RDBMS operations using Siddhi queries. The sample depicts a scenario in a sweet production factory. The sweet production details, such as the name of the raw material and amount used for production, can be stored using insertSweetProductionStream. The following streams can be used to search, delete, update, or upsert (update or insert) the existing data in the store:
    search - SearchSweetProductionStream
    insert - InsertSweetProductionStream
    delete - DeleteSweetProductionStream
    update - UpdateSweetProductionStream
    update or insert - UpdateOrInsertSweetProductionStream
    contains - ContainsSweetProductionStream (verifies whether all the attributes that enter in the stream exist in the store)

Prerequisites:
    1) Ensure that MySQL is installed on your machine.
    2) Add the MySQL JDBC driver into {Siddhi_Distribution_Home}/bundles as follows:
           a) Download the JDBC driver from: https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.45.tar.gz
           b) Unzip the archive.
           c) Copy mysql-connector-java-5.1.45-bin.jar to {Siddhi_Distribution_Home}/bundles directory.
    3) Create a database named 'production' in MySQL. This database is referred to with the 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/production' url.
    4) Create a table named 'SweetProductionTable': CREATE TABLE SweetProductionTable (name VARCHAR(20),amount double(10,2));
    5) Insert some values into the table: INSERT INTO SweetProductionTable VALUES ('Sugar',23.50);
       Note: You can also use insertSweetProductionStream for this.
    6) In the store configuration of this application, replace 'username' and 'password' values with your MySQL credentials.
    7) Save this sample.
    8) Restart the editor

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'.
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following message is shown on the console
        * PersistEventsInRDBMS.siddhi - Started Successfully!

    Note:
    If you want to edit this application while it's running, stop the application, make your edits and save the application, and then start it again.

Testing the Sample:
    1) Simulate single events:
        a) Click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab) and click 'Single Simulation'
        b) Select 'PersistEventsInRDBMS' as 'Siddhi App Name' and select 'SearchSweetProductionStream' as 'Stream Name'.
        c) Provide attribute values, and then click Send.
    2) Send at least one event where the name matches a name value in the data you previously inserted into the SweetProductionTable. This will satisfy the 'on' condition of the join query.
    3) Optionally, send events to the other corresponding streams to add, delete, update, insert, and search events.

    Notes:
    - After a change in the store, you can use the search stream to see whether the operation is successful.

Viewing the Results:
    See the output for raw materials on the console. You can use SearchSweetProductionStream to check for inserted, deleted, and updated events.
