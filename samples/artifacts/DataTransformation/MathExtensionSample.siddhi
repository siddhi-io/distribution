@App:description('Returns round up, natural logarithm and unbiased exponent of the sweets amount')

/*

Purpose:
	This Siddhi Application returns: 
	    1) The round up which is the smallest (closest to negative infinity) double value that is greater than or equal to the
	    p1 argument, and is equal to a mathematical integer. This function wraps thejava.lang.Math.ceil() method.
	    2) The natural logarithm (base e) of  p1.
	    3) The unbiased exponent used in the representation of p1. This function wraps the java.lang.Math.getExponent() function.

Prerequisites:
    * Save this sample. If there is no syntax error, the following messages would be shown on the console
	    * - Siddhi App MathExtensionSample successfully deployed.

Executing the Sample:
	1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'
	2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console
            * MathExtensionSample.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
    You can publish data event to the file, through event simulator
        a) Open event simulator by clicking on the second icon or press Ctrl+Shift+I.
    	b) In the Single Simulation tab of the panel, select values as follows:
                * Siddhi App Name  : MathExtensionSample
                * Stream Name      : SweetProductionStream
        c) Enter following values in the fields and send
                name: chocolate cake
                amount: 50.50
        d) Enter following values in the fields and send
                name: coffee cake
                amount: 50.30

Viewing the Results:
    Messages similar to the following would be shown on the console.
    INFO {io.siddhi.core.stream.output.sink.LogSink} - MathExtensionSample : AmountCorrectionStream : Event{timestamp=1569840715896, data=[chocolate cake, 51.0, 3.9219733362813143, 5], isExpired=false}
