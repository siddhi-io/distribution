@APP:description("Demonstrates how to calculate the standard deviation based on event timestamps")

/*

Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to simulate random events via Feed Simulation and calculate the standard deviation of events. The aggregation is executed on events within a external batch window.In this example it will processing the events that arrive every 2 sec from event time.
    
Prerequisites:
    1) Save this sample

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console
        * ExternalTimeBatchWindowStdDev.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:
    Configure random event simulation as follows
    1) Click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab)
    2) Click 'Feed Simulation' -> 'Create'
    3) Give a name (Or the default name in the place holder will be used as its name)
    4) Select 'Random' as the 'Simulation Source'
    5) Click on 'Add Simulation Source'
    6) Select ExternalTimeBatchWindowStdDev as 'Siddhi App Name'
    7) Select TradesStream as 'StreamName'
    8) Keep 'Primitive Based' as the config type for symbol,price,volume and eventTime moreover set the range from 0 to 9999999999 for eventTime and leave others attribute's range  as defalut.
    9) Save the simulator configuration
    10) The newly created simulator would be listed under 'Active Feed Simulations' of 'Feed Simulation' tab
    11) Click on the start button (Arrow symbol) next to the newly created simulator

Viewing the Results:
See the output on the console similar to the following (timestamp will be different). The output show the standard deviation for the events sent during last 2 sec from event time.
