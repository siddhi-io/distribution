@APP:description("Demonstrates how to calculate the sum of events by using a Siddhi timeBatch window.")

/*

Purpose:

    This application demonstrates how to simulate random events via Feed Simulation and calculate the sum of events. The aggregation is executed on events within a time batch window. A batch time window of 10 seconds is used in this sample. For more information on windows please refer to "https://siddhi.io/siddhi/documentation/siddhi-5.0/#window". The 'group by' clause helps to perform aggregation on events grouped by a certain attribute. In this sample, the symbol information per items is aggregated and summarized, for a window of 10 seconds in batch manner.

Prerequisites:

    1) Save this sample

Executing the Sample:

    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'

    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console

        * TimeBatchWindowSum.siddhi - Started Successfully!

Testing the Sample:

    Configure random event simulation as follows

    1) Click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab)

    2) Click 'Feed Simulation' -> 'Create'

    3) Give a name (Or the default name in the place holder will be used as its name)

    4) Select 'Random' as the 'Simulation Source'

    5) Click on 'Add Simulation Source'

    6) Select TimeBatchWindowSum as 'Siddhi App Name'

    7) Select TradesStream as 'StreamName'

    8) Keep 'Primitive Based' as the config type for symbol,price and volume

    9) Save the simulator configuration

    10) The newly created simulator would be listed under 'Active Feed Simulations' of 'Feed Simulation' tab

    11) Click on the start button (Arrow symbol) next to the newly created simulator

Viewing the Results:

See the output on the console similar to the following (timestamp will be different). The output show the total volume for the events sent during last 10 seconds in batch manner.
