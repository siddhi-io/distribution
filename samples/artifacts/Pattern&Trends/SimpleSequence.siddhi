@App:name("SimpleSequence")
@App:description("Allows you to detect the sequence of event occurrences over time.")

/*
Purpose:
    This application sends an alert if the increase in the temperature between two consecutive temperature events exceeds one degree for each rooms.

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages would be shown on the console
        * SimpleSequence.siddhi - Started Successfully!.

Testing the Sample:
    1) Click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab)
    2) Click 'Single Simulation' (this will be already selected)
    3) Select 'SimpleSequence' as Siddhi App Name
    4) Select 'TempStream' as StreamName
    5) Provide attribute values
        - roomNo: 1
        - amount: 35
    6) Send event
    7) Provide attribute values
        - roomNo: 1
        - amount: 35.5
    8) Send event
    9) Provide attribute values
        - roomNo: 1
        - amount: 36.3
    10) Send event
    11) Provide attribute values
        - roomNo: 1
        - amount: 38
    12) Send event

Viewing the Results:
    See the input and respective output on the console similar to the following (timestamp will be different).
