@App:description('Send events via HTTP transport using XML format')

/*

Purpose:
	This application demonstrates how to configure a siddhi application to send sweet production events via HTTP transport in XML default format.
    
Prerequisites:
	* Save this sample.
	     * - Siddhi App PublishHttpInXmlFormat successfully deployed. 
    
Executing the Sample:
	1) Start the Siddhi application by clicking on 'Run'.
	2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following messages are shown on the console:
            * PublishHttpInXmlFormat.siddhi - Started Successfully!
            * 'Http' sink at 'OutputStream' stream successfully connected to 'localhost:8080/abc'.

Testing the Sample:
   1) Open a terminal and navigate to {SiddhiHome}/samples/sample-clients/http-server and run "ant" command without any arguments.
   2) Send events using one or more of the following methods.
    * Send events with http server through the event simulator:
        a) Open the event simulator by clicking on the second icon or pressing Ctrl+Shift+I.
    	b) In the Single Simulation tab of the panel, specify the values as follows:
                * Siddhi App Name  : PublishHttpInXmlFormat
                * Stream Name      : SweetProductionStream
        c) In the name and amount fields, enter 'toffees' and '75.6' respectively and then click Send to send the event. 
        d) Send more events as desired.

Viewing the Results:
    See the output on the terminal.

Notes:
    If the message "OutputStream' stream could not connect to 'localhost:8080", it could be due to port 8080
    defined in the Siddhi application is already being used by a different program. To resolve this issue, do the following:
        1) Stop this Siddhi application (Click 'Run' on menu bar -> 'Stop').
        2) Change the port from 8080 to an unused port in this Siddhi application's source configuration and in the http-server file.
        3) Start the application and check whether the expected output appears on the console.
