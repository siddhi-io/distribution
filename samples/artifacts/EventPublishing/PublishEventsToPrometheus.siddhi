@App:description("Use siddhi-io-prometheus to publish events to Prometheus")

/*
Purpose:
    This application demonstrates how to use prometheus-sink to pusblish events to prometheus.

Pre-requisites:
    1) The following steps must be executed to enable WSO2 SP to publish and retrieve events via Prometheus.
        a) Download and copy the prometheus client jars to the {Siddhi_Distribution_Home}/bundles directory as follows.
              i) Download the following jars from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.prometheus and copy them to {Siddhi_Distribution_Home}/bundles directory.
                 * simpleclient_common-0.5.0.jar
                 * simpleclient-0.5.0.jar
		         * simpleclient_httpserver-0.5.0.jar
		         * simpleclient_pushgateway-0.5.0.jar
    2) Start the Siddhi_Distribution
    3) Save this sample
        "Siddhi App PublishEventsToPrometheus successfully deployed" message would be shown in the console

Executing the Sample:
    1) Start the Siddhi app by clicking on 'Run'.
    2) If the Siddhi application starts successfully, the following message is shown on the console
        * PublishEventsToPrometheus.siddhi - Started Successfully!
        * SinkStream has successfully connected at http://localhost:9080

Note:
    If you want to edit this application while it's running, stop the application, make your edits and save the application, and then start it again.

Testing the Sample:
    1) Simulate single events:
        a) Click on 'Event Simulator' (double arrows on left tab) and click 'Single Simulation'
        b) Select 'PublishEventsToPrometheus' as 'Siddhi App Name' and select 'InputStream' as 'Stream Name'.
        c) Provide attribute values, and then click Send.

Viewing the Results:
    Output similar to the following would be shown at the http end point http://localhost:9080/metrics
    -total_device_power_consumption_WATTS{deviceID="server004",roomID="roomNoF5",} 12.0
*/

define stream InputStream (deviceID string, roomID string,power int);

@sink(type='prometheus',
      job='prometheusSample',
      publish.mode='server',
      server.url='http://localhost:9080',
      metric.type='counter',
      value.attribute= 'power',
      metric.name= 'total_device_power_consumption_WATTS',
      metric.help= 'Total Power consumption of each devices in Watts',
      @map(type = 'keyvalue'))

Define stream SinkStream (deviceID string, roomID string, power int);

@info(name = 'publishQuery')
from InputStream
select *
insert into SinkStream;
